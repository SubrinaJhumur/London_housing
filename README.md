# LONDON HOUSING DATASET

This dataset is primarily centered around the housing market in London. It contains a lot of additional relevant data:
- Monthly average house prices
- Yearly number of houses sold
- Monthly number of crimes committed

The data used here is from years 1995 to 2019 for each different area.
this data is available as a CSV file, downloaded from Kaggle.
I will analyze this data using the Pandas data frame.

Here random sets of questions are given for which we have to find correct results.
This project is for beginners and for those who want to know how we analyze big data with Python.
